# Build and Run Screendrop

This skill builds the Screendrop macOS application via `xcodebuild`, kills any
running instance of the app (regardless of which scheme it was launched
from), then launches the newly built app.

## Steps

1. **Pick a scheme.** List the schemes available in the project:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project "/Users/fayazahmed/Developer/fayazara/mac/Screendrop/Screendrop.xcodeproj" \
  -list 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/Schemes:/,$p' | tail -n +2
```

- If there is only one scheme, use it without asking.
- If there is more than one scheme, ask the user which one to build/run
  (via AskUserQuestion) before proceeding, unless the user already named a
  scheme in their request (e.g. "run the Dev scheme"). Don't assume - the
  schemes can point at different configurations and bundle IDs (e.g.
  `Screendrop Dev` builds `Screendrop Dev.app` with its own bundle ID).

2. **Resolve build settings for the chosen scheme** - don't hardcode the
   configuration or output path, since it varies per scheme:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project "/Users/fayazahmed/Developer/fayazara/mac/Screendrop/Screendrop.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "<SCHEME_NAME>" -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -E "^\s*(CONFIGURATION|BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR|FULL_PRODUCT_NAME|EXECUTABLE_NAME) "
```

Use `CONFIGURATION` for the `-configuration` flag in the build step, and
`BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` + `FULL_PRODUCT_NAME` to construct the `.app` path for
the run step.

3. **Build** the project with the resolved scheme/configuration:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild build \
  -project "/Users/fayazahmed/Developer/fayazara/mac/Screendrop/Screendrop.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "<SCHEME_NAME>" \
  -configuration "<CONFIGURATION>" \
  -destination "platform=macOS" \
  2>&1 | grep -E "(BUILD SUCCEEDED|BUILD FAILED|error:)" | head -20
```

If the output shows `BUILD FAILED`, stop here, read the `error:` lines, and
help the user fix them. Do not proceed to run a broken build. If the output is
empty or unclear, re-run without the grep filter to get full output for
diagnosis.

4. **Kill every running instance of the app, across all schemes** - not just
   the one being launched. Different schemes can produce different
   executable names (`Screendrop`, `Screendrop Dev`), and leaving an old
   instance from another scheme running is confusing (duplicate menu bar
   icons, port/state conflicts, etc). Kill all known variants unconditionally
   before relaunching:

```bash
killall Screendrop 2>/dev/null
killall "Screendrop Dev" 2>/dev/null
```

(It's fine if these error because that variant wasn't running. If a new
scheme is added later with a different `EXECUTABLE_NAME`, add its `killall`
line here too - check with `EXECUTABLE_NAME` from step 2.)

5. **Run** the freshly built app using the path resolved in step 2:

```bash
open "<BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR>/<FULL_PRODUCT_NAME>"
```

## When to Use

- User says "run it", "build and run", "try it out", "relaunch the app"
- After making code changes, when the user wants to see the change live rather
  than just verify it compiles (for compile-only checks, use `build-screendrop`
  instead)

## Notes

- DerivedData paths are specific to this machine/checkout and can change
  between clean builds - always resolve `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` via
  `-showBuildSettings` (step 2) rather than assuming a fixed path.
