## Project overview

Screendrop is a native macOS screenshot and screen recording tool. Its Library window opens on normal launch; login launches remain in the menu bar (`LSUIElement = YES`). `AppActivationPolicy` uses `.regular` while Library, Settings, or editor windows are open, and returns to `.accessory` when they close. Built with SwiftUI + AppKit with a hostless Swift Testing unit test target.

**Deployment target:** macOS 26.0 for the app target (the project-level default says 26.4). Builds with the Xcode 26.4+ / Tahoe SDK.
**App:** Sukusho. **Bundle IDs:** `com.tommyent.Sukusho`, Dev `com.tommyent.Sukusho.dev`. The target, schemes and Swift module keep the name Screendrop.

## Build

Use `xcodebuild` from the command line. The project requires the Xcode 26.4 beta toolchain:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild build \
  -project Screendrop.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Screendrop \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination "platform=macOS" \
  2>&1 | grep -E "(BUILD SUCCEEDED|BUILD FAILED|error:)" | head -20
```

There are two shared schemes (`Screendrop` and `Screendrop Dev`) - both build the same target with Debug config. Use `Screendrop` unless told otherwise.

`ScreendropTests` is wired into both shared schemes. It compiles the selected production logic directly, with no app host, windows, permissions or live services.

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Screendrop.xcodeproj -scheme "Screendrop Dev" \
  -configuration "Debug Dev" -destination "platform=macOS" \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=NMM3956F6W -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

See `ScreendropTests/README.md` for coverage and fixture rules. Run tests before committing.

## Swift concurrency settings

The project uses **strict concurrency** settings that are easy to violate:

- `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` - every type is implicitly `@MainActor` unless explicitly opted out.
- `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY = YES`
- `SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_MEMBER_IMPORT_VISIBILITY = YES` - imports in one file do not leak to other files.

When adding new types, assume `@MainActor` isolation by default. If a type must be `Sendable` or `nonisolated`, mark it explicitly.

## Architecture

All source is in `Screendrop/` (flat, except the annotation engine in `Screendrop/Engine/`). Key flow:

1. **App entry** - `ScreendropApp.swift`: `@main` App struct. Creates a `MenuBarExtra`, a Settings window, and an annotation editor `WindowGroup`.
2. **Hotkeys** - `HotkeyManager.swift`: Registers global Carbon hotkeys (Option+1/2/3) at launch via `AppDelegate`.
3. **Capture** - `CaptureCoordinator.swift` → `ScreenshotManager.swift`: Fullscreen, window and area use the `/usr/sbin/screencapture` CLI; Scrolling Capture uses `ScreenCaptureKit`.
4. **Preview** - `PreviewPanelPresenter.swift` + `PreviewWindowView.swift`: Borderless floating `NSPanel` showing a screenshot stack. Uses `ScreenshotPreviewStack` (an `@Observable` model).
5. **Annotation** - `AnnotationEditorWindow.swift` + `AnnotationEditorModel.swift` + `AnnotationCanvas.swift`: Full annotation editor with tools (rectangle, ellipse, arrow, freehand, text, numbered circles, pixelate, blur). All coordinates are normalized (0..1) relative to the image.
6. **Rendering** - `AnnotationRenderer.swift`: Composites annotations onto the source image at full pixel resolution using Core Graphics.
7. **Preferences** - `ScreendropPreferences.swift` + `SettingsView.swift`: `UserDefaults`-backed settings (auto-save, auto-copy, auto-compress, export directory).
8. **Library** - `CaptureLibraryView.swift` + `CaptureLibraryModel.swift`: Single native sidebar/detail/inspector scene. `CaptureLibraryCollection.swift` reuses AppKit cells for grid/list layouts; `CaptureLibraryThumbnails.swift` bounds decoded image memory and concurrency. The model merges History metadata with recording packages by standardized package path. Existing capture storage and editable sidecars remain authoritative. `CaptureLibraryActions.swift` handles batch operations and prevents trashing captures while their editors are open.

### Singletons

Most managers are `static let shared` singletons: `ScreenshotManager`, `CaptureCoordinator`, `HotkeyManager`, `PreviewPanelPresenter`, `ScreenshotPreviewStack`, `PreviewWindowPlacement`, `PreviewWindowCaptureExclusion`. Follow this pattern for new services.

### Annotation coordinate system

All annotation positions/sizes are normalized to `[0, 1]` relative to the source image dimensions. Pixel conversion happens only in `AnnotationRenderer` at export time and in the canvas view for display. Do not use pixel coordinates in the model layer.

## Conventions

- **No new SPM packages or external dependencies.** Besides the existing Sparkle and DockProgress packages, the project uses only Apple frameworks (SwiftUI, AppKit, ScreenCaptureKit, CoreGraphics, CoreImage, ImageIO, Carbon).
- **`@Observable` macro** (Observation framework) is used for state - not `ObservableObject`/`@Published`.
- **App sandbox is disabled** (`ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO`) - the app needs screen capture permissions and direct filesystem access.
- Screenshots are saved as lossless PNG to `NSTemporaryDirectory()` first, then optionally compressed to JPEG on export.

## Commits

Make atomic commits. Each commit should represent exactly one logical change (e.g. one feature, one bug fix, one refactor). Do not bundle unrelated changes into a single commit. If a task touches multiple concerns, split it into separate commits. Verify the build passes before committing.

## Entitlements / permissions

- Screen recording permission (`NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription` in Info.plist) is required.
- Hardened runtime is enabled.
- No App Sandbox - do not add sandbox entitlements.
